                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Mercury has established itself as a newer but rapidly advancing power, specializing in technologies adapted to extreme environments. They maintain sophisticated orbital habitats and surface operations despite Mercury's harsh conditions.</p>
                
                <p>Unknown to the rest of the system, Mercury harbors a dark secret: a massive slave-based economy that would provoke system-wide intervention if discovered. This slave system provides Mercury with significant economic advantages while allowing them to bolster their official population numbers.</p>

                <h3>Technology and Resources</h3>
                <p>Mercury's proximity to the sun has driven innovation in heat management and radiation shielding, creating technologies valued throughout the system. Their extreme environment specialists are sought after for the most challenging habitat construction projects.</p>
                
                <p>The planet's rich mineral deposits, particularly rare-earth elements, form the foundation of their economy, with specialized mining operations extracting resources under conditions that would be prohibitive elsewhere.</p>

                <h3>Society and Culture</h3>
                <p>Mercury's visible society emphasizes technological achievement and adaptation to harsh conditions. Their educational system focuses heavily on engineering and materials science, producing specialists renowned throughout the system.</p>
                
                <p>Behind this facade, a rigid social hierarchy maintains control over their slave population, with sophisticated systems to prevent discovery by outside observers or diplomatic visitors.</p>
